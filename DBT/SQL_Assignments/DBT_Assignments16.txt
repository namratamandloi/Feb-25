1) Write a command that will enable a user to pull orders grouped by date out of the 
Orders table quickly.
mysql> SELECT order_date, COUNT(*) FROM Orders GROUP BY order_date;
Empty set (0.01 sec)

2) If the Orders table has already been created, how can you force the onum field to 
be unique (assume all current values are unique)? 
mysql> ALTER TABLE Orders ADD CONSTRAINT unique_onum UNIQUE (onum);
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.03 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 1

3) Create an index that would permit each salesperson to retrieve his or her orders 
grouped by date quickly. 
mysql> ALTER TABLE Orders ADD CONSTRAINT unique_onum UNIQUE (onum);

4) Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer of a given 
rating, and that this is currently the case. Enter a command that enforces it.
mysql> ALTER TABLE Customers ADD CONSTRAINT unique_salesperson_rating UNIQUE (salesperson_id, rating);
